Plugin to incorporate jQuery UI in posts and pages using shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to use jQuery UI's widgets with a simple to advanced shortcode in your pages or posts.

Here is a list of the current widgets and their corresponding shortcodes:
1. Dialog - Used with [pjjuh-dialog]*contents*[/pjjuh-tab] to create a button where the shortcode is inserted that will open a dialog with the contents of the tag (or you can set an attribute of page to a title of one of the pages on your site to load the contents of that page into the dialog that is opened from pressing the button). For more information on how to use this please visit my site. 
1. Tabs - Used with [pjjuh-tab-group] and then [pjjuh-tab title="tab-title"]*contents*[/pjjuh-tab] to create a tab with the title "tab-title" that contains the contents specified. For more information on how to use this please visit my site. 

Widgets I hope to add in the near future are:
1. Accordion
1. Tooltips

I also hope to allow more variations for the widgets in the near future.

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
